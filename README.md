  <h2>
    LoadVantage Web Project Application:
  </h2>

  <ul>
   <p> This web application was created as a final project in The Software University's ASP.NET Advanced Course 2024. It is a type of multiservice monolith. The application itself represents a load board web application that users ( Brokerage Firms and Truck Load Carriers ) can use to connect and do business. Users can be two types Brokers and Dispatchers. Brokers can create loads, post the them on the loadboard and on the other side a Dispatcher can book the load and assign a Driver and a Truck on it. After successful completion of the load the Dispatchers mark the load as delivered. Brokes can also unpost loads that are posted ( one or multiple ). They can cancel loads altogether ( essentially removing the load from their boards ) or cancel the Truck Load Carrier that is already assigned on the load. A Dispatcher can also cancel a load ( essentially returning the load to it's owner - the Broker that created it ).</p>

   <p> The application has two main roles --> üîµAdministrator and üî¥User. Registering an account creates only Users ( Two types of users --> Dispatcher and Broker ). 
        Administrators can either be directly seeded in the database or manually created by another Administrator using the User Management panel. </p>
    
   üîµ Administrators can manage users, manage loads, start a chat with all Users and other Administrators, view application statistics and pull pie chart reports. 
   </br>
   </br>
   üî¥ Dispatchers can book posted loads on the Load Board, manage trucks in their fleet, manage drivers in their company, return booked loads back to the owner ( Broker ), message any broker that has a Posted Load.
   </br>
   </br>
   üî¥ Brokers can create a load, edit a load ( in all statuses except Cancelled ), post a load, cancel a load, cancel a carrier assigned to a load (as long as they are the owner of the load ), chat with Users and Administrators ( if they are contacted first ),             </br>
   </br>

   ‚úÖ Both Users and Administrators can view their own profiles, summary of their loads if Brokers and summary of the Booked or Delivered loads if Dispatchers and a summary of their Trucks and Drivers, they can edit the profile information, edit or remove their profile picture<sup>üåü</sup> and change their password.
    </br>
    </br>
    <sup>üåü One difference here is that Administrators can use a .GIF image for their profile picture and Users cannot.</sup>
